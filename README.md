# Backdoor-creater-for-windows
Create backdoor in windows to change password/hack password of victim system


you MUST right click and run the batch file as administrator otherwise it will not install, you will still get the message saying the backdoor
was installed though.

when uninstalling you may want to manually delete the c:/backdoorbackup file.

there were some errors in that department that ended in the original sethc.exe being deleted and not replaced, leaving the system32 folder with
no sethc, therefore nothing happened when pressing shift five times.
